        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        This app is the result of my experiments conducted on Google App Engine. In this app I have combined a select few
        JavaEE technologies and fine tuned them to run on top of the Google App Engine stack. This app also showcases an
        approach for designing the entire application in a modular fashion.
