#### This is still a work-in-progress project

I have been tinkering around with an application that runs on top of Google App Engine for a while now.

I have decided to make my work available for others to play around with. Here you will find some rather useful pieces of code that will help you get started with designing a highly modular application using the following technology stack:

* JSF
* JPA
* CDI

Think of this project as my imaginary car engine that I keep tinkering every time I get a few hours of spare time :)

As my project matures, so will this README file.


Things that you will find here
==============================

* Gradle + GAE integration
* GAE + JSF + CDI => Tweaks
* DataNucleus Customizations - One persistence-unit and distributed entity classes
* Designing a modular JSF application
* Probably a bit of unusual coding styles :)

Remember, all of this is still WIP. I have been working on this project for a rather long period of time, so it is likely to have junk that needs to be cleaned out as well.
